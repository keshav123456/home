I'm a Cambridge computer science & management graduate, currently working in London. 

I love building things, big or small, hardware or software - making something people can use always gives me joy. That driving motivation has led to a diverse mix of experiences, from founding my own startup, research to big tech roles at Palantir. Lately however, I'm far more interested in how technology affects society, how we can regulate and guide these amazing creations of ours to help society in the best way possible. From misinformation to platform governance

Outside of computer science - I read a bunch of sci-fi (will recommend Cixin Liu to anybody who listens), play Cricket and Squash fairly seriously, but will attempt to play any racket sport in my vicinity.
