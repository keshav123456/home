I'm a Cambridge computer science & management graduate, love building interesting things, 

I'm generally very interested in how technology affects society, and how we can influence it to
 misinformation and generally how the world works (or rather how it doesnâ€™t....)
My journey so far has been a diverse mix of experiences, from founding my own startup to big tech roles at Palantir.

Outside of that I read a bunch of sci-fi (will recommend Cixin Liu to anybody who will listen), play Cricket and Squash (and any racket sport in my vicinity)
