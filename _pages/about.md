I'm a Cambridge computer science & management graduate, currently working in London. 

I love building things, big or small, hardware or software - making something people can use always gives me joy. That driving motivation has led to a diverse mix of experiences, from founding my own startup, research to big tech roles at Palantir. Lately however, I'm far more interested in tech policy & how technology affects society. Having first-hand witnessed all our inventions being used in problematic ways - from generating misinformation to polarising the world and advantaging few over the many - I'm curious to explore solutions that either regulate or guide them to be used in more equal and equitable ways. 

Outside of computer science - I read a bunch of sci-fi (will recommend Cixin Liu to anybody who listens), play Cricket and Squash fairly seriously, but will attempt to play any racket sport in my vicinity.
